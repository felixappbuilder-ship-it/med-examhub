    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "As the respiratory tree branches and becomes smaller, the epithelium changes from pseudostratified ciliated columnar in the bronchi to simple columnar, and finally to simple cuboidal in the terminal bronchioles.",

    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Desmosomes are spot-welds that provide extremely strong adhesion between cells. They are abundant in tissues like the epidermis and cardiac muscle, which are subjected to significant mechanical stress.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Stem cells located in the bases of the intestinal crypts continuously divide. Their progeny differentiate into the various epithelial cell types as they migrate upward to cover the villi, replacing cells that are shed at the tip.",

    "options": [
      "Number of cell layers and cell shape",
      "Type of extracellular matrix",
      "Presence or absence of cilia",
      "The nature of the connective tissue underneath"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Epithelia are classified based on two fundamental characteristics: the number of cell layers (simple = one layer, stratified = multiple layers) and the shape of the cells in the apical layer (squamous, cuboidal, or columnar).",
