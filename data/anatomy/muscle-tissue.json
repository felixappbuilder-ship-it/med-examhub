    "question": "Which characteristic distinguishes visceral (single-unit) smooth muscle?",
    "options": [
      "Each fiber contracts independently",
      "Rich autonomic innervation of each fiber",
      "Gap junctions coordinate contraction",
      "Found in the iris of the eye"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Visceral smooth muscle has abundant gap junctions that allow the tissue to contract as a single unit. It is found in hollow organs like the uterus, GI tract, and urinary bladder.",

    "question": "What causes muscle fatigue during prolonged exercise?",
    "options": [
      "Depletion of ATP stores",
      "Accumulation of lactic acid",
      "Glycogen depletion and ion imbalance",
      "All of the above"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "Muscle fatigue results from multiple factors including ATP depletion, lactic acid accumulation, glycogen depletion, and disruption of calcium and potassium ion balance.",
